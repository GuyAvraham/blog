      <description>What I found by building my own NodeJS boilerplate. Mongoose Tips Iâ€™ve played with Mongoose a lot in the past week. Iâ€™ve built a NodeJS API boilerplate for help me kickstart some REST API project. I setup the regular auth using PassportJS with the local and JWT strategies. By doing this I found some useful tricks with Mongoose. Some tips I never really see somewhere â€˜maybe I didnâ€™t search lot ðŸ˜ƒâ€™ and I want to share you what I found.</description>

      <description>VSC: Visual Studio Code
Why I moved away from Atom I was an Atom user for nearly a year. Everything about this text editor was perfect for me. For starters, the packages manager was much more beginner friendly than Sublime. Also, there were always new updates which seemed to make my text editor more and more powerful with each update. But 4 months ago I started to feel the pain of the slow speed of Atom.</description>

      <description>Testing your API with Postman I&amp;rsquo;m sure you already know the famous tool call Postman. This is a super useful tool for test your API and looks at the response you get from your server. But I see a lot of people just using it as a manual tester. This is not wrong but you can get much better productivity with if you use some of Postman features.
Create your first Simple Test First thing this is a simple controller in your app where you can fetch a unique post with is ID as params.</description>

      <description>Intro 2016 was a big year for me. First thing, I start coding the 6 January 2016 so today is my first full year finish. Coming from an Army background this was one of the biggest moves of my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve always done a physical job and this one we all know is really more technical. I found by coding every day in the year &amp;ldquo;Yes 365days last year I have touched my PC and coded&amp;rdquo; that I love that more and more.</description>
