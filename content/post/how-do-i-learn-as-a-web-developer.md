## Intro

I got ask quite often on my youtube channel how do I learn new "technology", "framework", "library" etc. I was trying to answer this question and feel why not wrote a blog post about it, maybe that can help someone else.

## About myself

So first I don't code for a long time. I start in 2016 with [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and there html/css track. I was sure this is how hacker do there stuff :) But after like 2-3 hours I figure out than I do nothing more than just ui stuff :). So because I'm a curious person I decide why not search for tutorial on youtube. I found this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-1HCWbu7iU&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-), where this youtuber create real app in 1 week each. I was amaze by his workflow and follow him on everything he did. But stop, this is Ruby on Rails ? You don't know Ruby, so how can you do this. Yes this is true. I didn't know nothing about ruby. It was my third day in the coding world and the only I know was how to make a list in a html file and put a background color of red for this last one.

But yes I jump right away and follow his code. Enter each line of his code and don't even understand 20% of it. But that was fun. If I follow him without and get luck to not getting any typo I got the same thing working on my computer. When I came to the 6-7 project I start to see a pattern, I start to see ok so this is how you do this etc. I remember watching his video like 2-3 again and again. After that I was able to do the same almost by heart, without checking a lot, all that from memory. When I finish his playlist I figure out I need to know a bit more about Ruby and so I search about it. Come back to [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) doing the ruby path and the ruby on rails on right after.

After a month or two, I was really struggle with my code, never was able to make something interactive etc. Why ? Because I was missing some javascript knowledge. And so I jump on the javascript wagon and never really come back from it.

## Ok but why say that ?

Inside his playlist what he was doing was about to clone an app like Pinterest or Wikipedia. And this is how I learn. I see lot and lot of people asking on some Facebook group or even on Slack/Discord about what can I build for learning. What can I make, which feature etc. When I figured then why loose time about thinking of the feature and more on the code this is how I start to really improve my learning process. What I mean by that ? Example you want to do a Twitter clone. You already know all the feature to make and even the UI to do. So you don't loose precious hours of your learning about searching which feature I can make to show and or learn.

By also cloning the UI you learn what to do when a designer gonna give you a PSD or Sketch File. If you can make it 100% pixel perfect you ROCK, but even if you struggle you can search in the css file with the browser Devtool. So it's almost impossible to not be able to complete it.

For the business logic and stuff like this, where you can struggle a bit gonna be about how they do this kind of stuff etc. But for lot of the part you can make it with simple CRUD.
